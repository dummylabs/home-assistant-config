- `auto` - automatic breezer control depending on the CO2 level
- `2-4`, `1-3`, `4-6`... etc - automatic control with set speed range
### climate.set_hvac_mode 
`hvac_mode` defines your breezer's heater state:

- `fan_only` - heater off
### climate.set_temperature 
can be used to set target temperature for heater by setting `temperature` parameter
